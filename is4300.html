                                <p>A mobile app that asks a simple flashcard question at different times during the day. One of the most common methods for remembering information is to make flashcards.  However, a single successful pass through your flashcard set doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve absorbed all the information. I have frequently successfully gone through my entire flash card set one night, only to wake up remembering only half of the information. With this app, users scan in their cards, and in the week before their exam date, the app will ask questions at different intervals everyday, so you can evaluate if you’ve actually absorbed the material or not. Users can set time intervals so that questions will only be asked when they are free to respond, but the exact time within that interval will be randomized, so users don’t get used to a pattern.  Additional augmented reality view can display a single or a set of cards in space that flip to display answers. Or, questions can be displayed in front of the user, and answers to the side, so viewers look to the side for the answer.

                                <p>Most classrooms and every large lecture space at Northeastern University has microphones that professors can use. Therefore, transcripts for every lecture can be auto-generated as long as microphones are turned on. Tegrity recorded lectures often have unclear audio, and the videos might even be unhelpful. A time-stamped text document that users can follow along to will always be clear. These text documents would be organized and distributed via a web app that Northeastern students can login to.  Professors can “highlight” specific transcripts as important, and students can “favorite” their own transcripts.The ability to download transcripts removes allows for offline viewing and printing.

                                <h5>Group Meeting Status Tracker</h5>
                                <p>Coordinating group meetings through a group chat is quite annoying. Most of the time people 
                                    don’t bother opening the chat, or worse, open the chat and never respond. This mobile app 
                                    would simplify the entire process. Once downloaded, users join the group project. Users 
                                    input their availabilities, and the app auto-generates potential meeting times where 
                                    everyone is free. Once the group decides on a meeting time, this time is set. In the
                                    hour before the meeting, the app sends a notification to all members of the project, 
                                    asking them to if they are either: on their way, already there, or not going.  
                                    Individual statuses are visible to all, and if a member has not opened up the app 
                                    within that hour, they are automatically marked as “not going” 10 minutes before 
                                    the meeting time. This way, groups have a clear picture of who is coming, and who
                                    is not, without any doubt.

                                <p>TRACE evaluations are performed at the end of every semester so professors can receive 
                                    feedback about their course. However, many students feel that this is already too late, 
                                    changes that might have benefited them can only be implemented in the next semester. 
                                    An anonymous feedback tool would allow for students to leave feedback during the 
                                    current semester. Users create anonymous posts that can be “liked” to show agreement. 
                                    The content of the posts is limited to the course structure and feedback about the 
                                    professor.  If a certain threshold of “likes” is reached, a post can be forwarded 
                                    to a superior that can choose to issue a statement. The superior will see the
                                    names of the students, keeping a degree of accountability.

                                <p>A bluetooth device that connects to your laptop that when activated, closes all non-productivity applications, and tabs in the web browser.  A desktop GUI application exists where users can add specific websites and applications that they classify as "non-productivity" to be closed. Distraction Destroyer will track metrics like the amount of time spent on applications, the amount of elapsed time before “non-productive” applications are opened again, and more, then create interesting data visualizations.  The device itself is small and has only one button. When pressed, all distractions are destroyed.  An optional "nuclear winter" option then blocks the re-opening of all "non-productivity" applications and sites for a set amount of time.

                                <p>Pomodoro clocks are timers for 30 minutes, and are frequently used as a study tool. One starts the timer, and studies until it rings. A mobile app pomodoro clock that is activated when a user enters an on campus library or study space would push users to start being productive right away, as the timer starts as soon as they enter an on campus library or study space. Users can toggle blackout times for when they don't want the clock to start automatically, but the app will default to the automatic location based start. A fun visual (not basic text) representation of a pomodoro clock is the homescreen of the app. Users can also add additional off-campus buildings and locations as well, such as their favorite coffee shop.

                                <p>An app to improve the coordination of group meetings.
                                    Coordinating group projects is primarily done through group chats, and is quite annoying.  Most of the time people don’t bother opening the chat, or worse, open the chat and never respond. The time spent coordinating meetings and checking in on unresponsive individuals is valuable time that could have been spent on the project, therefore a solution to this problem would be very beneficial. Current scheduling tools are limited to calendars, and individual schedulers that require a new URL for every event.  No current solutions allow users to check the en route status of other members.  
                                    This mobile app would simplify the entire process. Once downloaded, users input their availabilities, and the app auto-generates meeting times where everyone is free. Users vote on times that they prefer, and the meeting time is set. This app also tracks the travel status of members in the hour before the meeting starts, eliminating the need to ask individual members if they’re coming, if they’re on their way, etc.  In the hour before the meeting, the app sends a notification to all members of the project, asking them if they are either: on the way, already there, will be late, or not going.  Individual statuses are visible to all, and if a member has not opened up the app within that hour, they are automatically marked as “not going” 30 minutes before the meeting time. This way, groups have a clear picture of who is coming, and who is not, without having to manage coordination between many individuals.  An additional novel view presents the meeting times and statuses in augmented reality.

                                <h5>Daily Flashcard Notifications - Studify? </h5>
                                <p>A mobile app that asks a simple flashcard question at different times during the day.  One of the most common methods for remembering information is to make flashcards.  However, a single successful pass through your flashcard set doesn’t mean you’ve absorbed all the information. I have frequently successfully gone through my entire flash card set one night, only to wake up remembering only half of the information. The proven method for memorization is repeated exercise over several days.  
                                    With this app, users scan in their cards, and in the week before their exam date, the app will ask a question at random intervals throughout the day, everyday, so users can evaluate if they’ve actually absorbed the material or not.  This method of repeated interaction ensures stronger recall ability.  Users can set black out times where no questions will be asked, and how many questions will be asked.  Users can also view and study all their flashcards at once like other flashcard apps.  The ability to scan in flashcards and have them automatically parsed combined with dynamic study sessions sets this app apart from other existing flashcard apps. An additional augmented reality view can display a single or a set of cards in space that flip to display answers. Or, questions can be displayed in front of the user, and answers to the side, so viewers look to the side for the answer.
